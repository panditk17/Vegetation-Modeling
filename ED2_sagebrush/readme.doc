Modified source codes for ED2 with shrub parameters
# Original Ecosystem Demography (ED2) model was developed by Moorcroft et al., 2001, Medvigy et al., 2009, Longo et al., 2019, and team, which is available at github (https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2).
# This repository contains modified Ecosystem Demography (ED2) model for sagebrush (shrub) PFT. In order to do so we primarily updated ed_params.F90 in the source code with additional PFT, which is represented by number '18'. For the initial works, we selected allometrics equations for temperate PFTs in ED2 to develop coefficients (parameters) related to allometric relationships (such as dbh to height , dbh to leaf biomass etc). We used cube root of volume to represent diameter to calculate allometric equations for shrubs, since they do not have clear main trunk like trees. Another source code ed_max_dims.F90 was also changed to update PFT dimensions.  
# This repository also includes namelist file (ED2IN), input data (met data and vegetation data) to run model simulations for shrub ecosystem, and output data (sensitivity analysis and calibration) generated from model runs
